# Blog-Analytics-with-Express-and-Lodash

Developed a blog analytics and search tool using Express.js and Lodash. The goal was to create a middle ware that analyzes the data retrieved from a third-party blog API (provided via the given curl request) and provides insightful statistics to clients. Additionally, implemented a blog search endpoint.

In the blog.js file I have performed the following operations:-
1) Data retrieval
2) Data analysis
3) Response
4) Blog search endpoint
5) Error handling
